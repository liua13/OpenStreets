# OpenStreets

Litter in beaches, parks, and our own streets not only harms the environment, but can also cause severe accidents in our communities. Every year, 25,000 accidents are caused in USA by litter, 1 million seabirds are killed by litter every year, and 100,000 turtles and marine mammals die because of litter. To increase the safety of our streets, we also decided to focus on senior and non-able-bodied citizens, who may find it difficult to complete activities like shoveling snow and raking leaves. We created a crowdsourcing platform that addresses these issues by increasing awareness of the environment and providing opportunities for people to contribute back to their communities in a meaningful way.
